# The MVC-Tech-Blog

  ## Description 
  The purpose of this application was to built a full stack application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) along with the corresponding technologies such as express-handlebars, dontenv, bcrypt, express-sessions, and a connect-session-sequelize. Bringing these technologies I created a Tech-Blog app, which allows the user to post blog posts and comment to other developers in the industry. Users can create accounts, edit and delete their posts and have the interaction of blog app at their convenience. 

  This application is using Express.js API in conjunction with Sequelize to access with a MySQL database for the full back end support for any E-Commerce website.

  ## Features
  The features of this application is to provide a full functional back end application capable of support an blog posting site. At the moment there is no front end development or website to explore the user experience. In future iterations that would be planned for further development. I am hosting this on Heroku website for presentation.
